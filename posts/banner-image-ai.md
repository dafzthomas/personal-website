This is a first for me - an AI based project. I have seen few appear and it's interesting to see projects surfacing capabilities for everyone to be able to use.

I hope to create more projects using some form of AI that is useful for people.

This one is simple - an AI that can generate gradient images for use on your social media or website. It will be tweaked as soon as I understand "prompt programming" ðŸ˜‚.

Thanks for taking the time to take a look.

F.Y.I. There is no free option for this as it's very expensive to run AI software.
